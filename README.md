# Numfinity

A work in progress on a new type of variable that allows to store massive numbers.

When the Python 3 version is finished (or at least functional) I plan to transcribe it to Java.

## How to use

**Python 3:** Download the file "Numfinity.py" and import it using `from Numfinity import Numfinity`.

## Notes

The methods with a "_" at the end of its name are not supposed to be used by the user.
